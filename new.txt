Got it. For a right-angled triangle, if you need the actual numbers for 
a
, 
b
, and 
c
, you can use the Pythagorean theorem I mentioned:

If you know 
a
 and 
b
, 
c
=
a
2
+
b
2

If you know 
a
 and 
c
, 
b
=
c
2
−
a
2

If you know 
b
 and 
c
, 
a
=
c
2
−
b
2

Let’s plug in some numbers. Say 
a
=
3
 and 
b
=
4
:

c
=
3
2
+
4
2
=
9
+
16
=
25
=
5

So with these values, the sides of your right-angled triangle would be 3, 4, and 5. Makes sense?
